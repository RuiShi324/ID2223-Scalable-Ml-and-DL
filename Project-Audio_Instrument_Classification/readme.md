# Audio instruments classification
In this project, we make models to make classifications of 10 different instruments, including saxophone, guitar, violin and so on. The models are based on 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, 2-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory. We process the audio from Kapre because it can compute STFT and Melspectrogram. 

# Environment
The project is based Google colab and TF. 

# How to run the code
You need to open the .ipynb file in Google colab, also upload all the files into your google drive and match the correct path, then execute the "set the environment". You should be able to run this code.

# The structure of the .zip file
The file "wavfiles" include all the original datasets we use. Then we clean the data and split them into the file "cleaned_dataset". The process of training is stored in the file "logs". Other necessary explanation is included in the .ipynb file.

If you have any questions regarding the code, welcome to contact me at srui@kth.se . Thanks for your time!
