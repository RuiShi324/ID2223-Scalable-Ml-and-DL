# ID2223-Scalabale-ML-and-DL
Two lab sessions and one project for couse ID2223 - Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning

# Content
## Lab 1
Machine Learning with Spark ML. we view and prepare the data, and then use linear regression model, decision tree classification, random forest regression and gradient-boosted tree regression to train and test.

## Lab 2
Train a network to produce sentence embedding, by implementing the proposed method of the Sentence-BERT (S-BERT). We download and prepare data, fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer network, and finally evaluate on the official Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmark. We use my best fine-tuned model and creat a small semantic search system. 

## Project - Audio Instrument Classification
Make models to make classifications of 10 different instruments, including saxophone, guitar, violin and so on. The models are based on 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, 2-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory. We process the audio from Kapre because it can compute STFT and Melspectrogram.
